# Tree URL Crawler

Enter a URL and it will crawl, explore, and collect the URLs for you!

Built using Go. I created this project as a way to practice using Go and its concurrency features.

The crawler includes rate-limiting and basic caching capabilities, and uses a simple Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm for crawling.
